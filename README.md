# odin-recipes
My first Odin project!
I will build a basic recipe website which will put to use the HTML 
skills I have learned as well as my ability to navigate using the 
command terminal and utilize GitHub and Git for version control.

I have created a basic recipe website using only HTML. There is a main page 
that links to different recipes each complete with an image with alt text, 
an ingredient list, and steps on how to make the recipe.

I have demonstrated very basic HTML skills.
