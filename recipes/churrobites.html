            <li>1 (8.8 ounce) box mini peanut butter sandwich crackers (such as RitzÂ® Bits Peanut Butter)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup salted butter, cut into cubes</li>
            <li>1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a large-rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Add crackers in one even layer.</li>
            <li>Add butter, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to a saucepan over medium-high heat; cook, stirring often, until well combined and simmering, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Carefully pour butter mixture over the layer of crackers. Using a silicone spatula, toss crackers until well coated in butter mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and golden brown, about 10 minutes, flipping and tossing crackers halfway through cooking time.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, stir granulated sugar and remaining 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon together in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Remove crackers from the oven and allow to cool, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and toss with cinnamon sugar mixture until well coated. Transfer to a serving bowl.</li>
        </ol>
